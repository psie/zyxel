# CVE-2022-45439 - Hidden wireless network with predictable password

Affected: Zyxel AX7501-B0 - firmware up to and including version V5.17(ABPC.3)B5

Zyxel AX7501-B0 in vulnerable versions has two extra wireless networks enabled. Threat actors wihin radio proximity may grain access to the WLAN. The networks are bridged on the same interface as the main network. Networks are "hidden" - no SSID advertised. Networks are not visible and can not be disabled neither through the web UI nor through ZySH. Network #1 (wl0.4) has a predictable name and password - `ssid=Zyx31@1989816`, `wpa_passphrase=1989&13xyZ#816`. Network #2's (wl0.5) name and password appear to be random - `ssid=18d1581d09a90f405921331664888ea`, `wpa_passphrase=d7b51f38ecbf6188fcbf63cc76f42198`. It's unclear whether those credentials differ between different firmware builds. Network #2's credentials are said to regenerate upon resets to factory settings. Both networks grant access equivalent to the main wireless network (WLAN). Firmware version V5.17(ABPC.3)C0 removes Network #1. 

The vulnerability can be confirmed through accessing a config file using a symlink on the ftp (CVE-2022-45440, may require phyisical access):

`ln -s /tmp/wl0_hapd.conf wl0_hapd.conf`

Alternatively, credentials to Network 1. may be bruteforced and association with the AP can be tested in practice.

Thanks to Zyxel for addressing the issue.
